# A2SV Practice Questions

A structured and continuously growing collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems solved during my preparation with the **A2SV (Africa to Silicon Valley)** program.

This repository is designed with a **clean, professional, and scalable structure** to:

- Track daily problem-solving progress
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Practice competitive programming
- Maintain readable and well-documented solutions
- Build a strong GitHub portfolio

# Per-Problem File Standard

Every problem follows the **same consistent format**:

### Solution file (`.py`)

Contains **code only**.

```python
# Problem Title
# Platform

Class Solution:
    def method_name(self, parameters):
        # implementation
        pass
```

---

### README.md

Contains:

- Problem statement
- Approach / intuition
- Algorithm explanation
- Time & space complexity

---

### NOTES.md

Contains:

- Personal observations
- Mistakes
- Edge cases
- Alternative solutions
- Tricks learned

---

# Naming Conventions

### LeetCode

```
[number]-[Title]
Example: 67-Missing-Number
```

### Codeforces

```
codeforces-[title]
```

### HackerRank

```
hacker-rank-[title]
```

### GeeksforGeeks

```
geeksforgeeks-[title]
```

Spaces → replaced with `-` for clean URLs.

# Automation

This repository includes:

### `create_problem.py`

A custom script that automatically:

- Creates correct folder structure
- Generates solution template
- Generates README template
- Generates NOTES template
- Opens VS Code instantly

### Usage

```bash
python create_problem.py
```

This keeps everything:
✔ consistent
✔ fast
✔ mistake-free
